E-learning platform with REST API and Memcached  
Memcached is a general-purpose distributed memory-caching system. It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data
and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source must be read.

for me i use linux so here is the way:
`sudo apt install memcached`
`sudo apt install libmemcached-tools`

then install `pip install -r requirements.txt`
